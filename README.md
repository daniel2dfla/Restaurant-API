# Restaurant-API

The Restaurant-API project is a robust and comprehensive solution aimed at providing a highly functional API for restaurant management. Developed using the MongoDB database, the system integrates a comprehensive set of features to deliver a refined user experience.

Security is a fundamental priority in the project, with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication ensuring the protection of sensitive data and user identity validation. To manage access to resources, role-based authorizations with guards have been implemented, providing granular control over each user's permissions.

With a robust and scalable architecture, the Restaurant-API is an ideal tool for businesses in the gastronomy sector seeking a complete and reliable solution to manage their operations efficiently and securely.
